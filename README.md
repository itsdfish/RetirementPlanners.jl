# Disclaimer

Monte Carlo simulations are useful tools for stress testing financial/retirement plans under a wide range of uncertain conditions. As with any model, the Monte Carlo simulation is only as good as the assumptions one makes. This package is not intended to be financial advice. Instead, it is an open source tool for planning and research. Users must make assumptions in the Monte Carlo simulation at their discretion.  When in doubt, seek the counsel of a professional financial planner.
